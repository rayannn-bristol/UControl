# UControl

UControl recipes is an android recipe application which uses the Spoonacular API to retrieve recipes. The application integrates a local SQLite database which is used to store recipes of the users' choice for offline viewing.

To set up this application:
 1) Download files and open in android studio.
 2) Run application through emulator or physical device.
 

If the spoonacular API is not responding due to reaching daily quota, switch to another key in the API Java class or provide a new one.
