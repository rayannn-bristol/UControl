# UControl

UControl recipes is an android recipe application which uses the Spoonacular API to retrieve recipes. The application integrates a local SQLite database which is used to store recipes of the users' choice for offline viewing.

To set up this application:
 1) Download files and open in android studio.
 2) Run application through emulator or physical device.
 

Due to the cost restriction, we are using a limited edition of the spoonacular API which allows 150 request, hence it may not respond. In this instance replace the following api key "7b75441a43db438e960800c7c99a8e3c" with the one located in the API Key class.
