# UControl Recipes

UControl recipes is an application developed by the Creators group as their Final Year project.  

The application's purpose is to produce a modern-day recipe book in the form of an easy-to-use Android app that leverages the Spoonacular API to access a variety of recipes as well as extra features. UControl Recipes will allow users to identify recipes based on the resources they have at their disposal or the constraints they have put on themselves. This software's key features include the ability to search for recipes by component, calorie count, price range, and preparation time. The program enables users to exchange recipes with their friends via social networking sites such as Facebook and WhatsApp, as well as save recipes for later reference by connecting with a local SQLite database, all while introducing them to a variety of new delicacies. UControl recipes may be utilized by a wide spectrum of users, although the application's primary beneficiaries are health enthusiasts, university students, and people attempting to gain or lose weight.

Due to the cost restriction, we are using a limited edition of the spoonacular API which allows 150 request, hence it may not respond. In this instance replace the following api key "7b75441a43db438e960800c7c99a8e3c" with the one located in the API Key class.
